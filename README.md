# About My Project: Heart Attack Analysis
My project is about heart attack analysis. In the data set, there are several different variables recorded from 303 participants. By analyzing these variables, I'm trying to find out people with what characteristics are more likely to have heart attacks. Then, I want to know whether a heart attack is more likely to cause by external or internal factors. The ultimate goal is trying to let more audiences know about heart attack and prevent it from happening. 

I inlcuded my work below including a Jupyter notebook and a poster.

# More
New to python and data analysis, trying around with different tools to create visualizations. Not perfect, open to suggestions:)
